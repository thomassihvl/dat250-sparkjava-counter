# DAT250 expass 4

## Setup problems
In experiment 1 i had an issue where intellij froze when loading the cloned github project.
After force closing it the repository was acting weird in different ways, so i 
reloaded the .idea file and rebuilt the project.

Following this I got an issue where I couldn't run App.java and it looked like it had
something to do with port 8080. I found the number 8080 in the code and changed it to 8000.
This did the trick and I could start with the tutorial.

I took some time figuring out how the API was supposed to look like as I couldn't find the 
mentioned lecture notes. This went alright, and I cleared the tests one and one until
I reached the one testing for non-numericals. I thought this test failed for my get implementation
for a long time, while it actually failed for my not-yet-implemented put method. This reminded me to take a
break hehe...

I completed the code and made sure the tests were green. The code is not pretty, lots of it is redundant.
But I've used a lot of time and learned a lot, so I'll say it's good enough.
